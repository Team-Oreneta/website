<p>We met on <a href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a>&#39;s Slack while chatting about operating systems (we were very bored). After some minutes of yapping, we all came to the conclusion we should just make our very own OS! That&#39;s how <a href="/projects/oreneta">Oreneta</a> was born, and therefore <strong>Team Oreneta</strong>.</p>
<p>Team Oreneta came after Oreneta, when we three decided to create a team out of this <em>wonderful</em> project!
We wanted to collaborate on more stuff than just Oreneta (for instance, <a href="https://poyoweb.org">The PoyoWeb!</a>), because we really like working with eachother. &lt;3</p>
<p>And well, that&#39;s really it! We have become friends all together and enjoy spending our spare time coding.
Thanks for your attention!</p>
<p>--Poyo!</p>
