# Future Computing, LLC
## Protecting Open Source Developers

**Future Computing, LLC** is a company founded by Jake meant to *protect open source developers* and the projects they make. The company's **Protect Open Source** initiative created the Open Source Creator's Share License to let open source devs keep control of who can sell their projects, and is working with PoyoWeb to provide cheap or free infrastructure to open source projects, away from corporate greed. Future Computing also helps Jake distribute his own open source projects.
