# Welcome! We're Team Oreneta
## A group of entrepeneur teens around the world who enjoy building cool stuff, all together! 

Howdy, fellow internaut! Looks like you've stumbled upon our smol website, or perhaps someone just sent it to you.
Anyways, we will first introduce ourselves. At the time of writing this post, we're 3 founding members; *Segfault*, *Jake* and, last but not less important, *Poyo*. 
| Name     | Specialty                     | Country |     Coolest Side Projects    |
|----------|-------------------------------|---------|------------------------------|
| Segfault | Low Level Programming         | USA     | Rust web browser and chat application |
| Jake     | SysAdmin & Unix/Linux Nerdery | USA     | Future Computing. LLC, Protect Open Source, A lot more |
| Poyo     | Project Lead and Web Dev      | Spain   | PoyoWeb, Pictoroom, TOO MANY PROJECTS           |

We met on [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com)'s Slack while chatting about operating systems (we were very bored). After some minutes of yapping, we all came to the conclusion we should just make our very own OS! That's how [Oreneta](/projects/oreneta) was born, and therefore __Team Oreneta__.

Team Oreneta came after Oreneta, when we three decided to create a team out of this *wonderful* project!
We wanted to collaborate on more stuff than just Oreneta (for instance, (The PoyoWeb!)[https://poyoweb.org]), because we really like working with eachother. <3

And well, that's really it! We have become friends all together and enjoy spending our spare time coding.
Thanks for your attention!
